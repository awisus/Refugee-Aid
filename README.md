# Refugee-Aid
Project intended to give refugees a chance to utter their needs themselves.
General public may see those needs collected by accommodations on a map.
So they become aware of help facilities in their area and what is really urgent.

This is the Android frontend created by awisus for the upcoming platform done by tokix.
We use the Google Maps platform to make accmommodations visible to the user.
By clicking a mark on the map they get further information, most importantly required needs.
